# Rabbit E-Commerce Frontend Deployment Guide

## Recent Updates and Fixes

We've made several important updates to improve the frontend application's reliability, especially for product data fetching:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling in API calls for Best Sellers, New Arrivals, and "You May Also Like" sections
   - Implemented graceful fallback UIs when products cannot be loaded
   - Added loading states for a better user experience

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Updated the Vercel configuration to properly handle CORS issues with the backend

3. **API Request Improvements**:
   - Added timeouts to prevent hanging requests
   - Improved error logging for easier debugging
   - Better validation of API responses

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Commit All Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed product fetching and improved error handling"
```

### 2. Push to Your Repository

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option A: Automatic Deployment (If already configured)
- The changes will automatically deploy if you have connected your GitHub repository to Vercel with automatic deployments enabled.

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
1. Log in to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Click "Deploy" to trigger a new deployment

### 4. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project:
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: https://rabbit-backend.vercel.app
- `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`: (your PayPal client ID)

You can check these in the Vercel dashboard under your project settings > Environment Variables.

### 5. Verify Deployment

After deployment completes:
1. Visit your deployed site (https://rabbit-frontend.vercel.app)
2. Verify that the Best Sellers, New Arrivals, and "You May Also Like" sections load correctly
3. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Network Tab**: In browser DevTools, examine network requests to see if they're reaching the backend
2. **Verify CORS Headers**: Ensure the backend is returning proper CORS headers
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Have users clear their browser cache if they're experiencing stale data

## Backend Updates

Note that we've also updated the backend with:
- Enhanced CORS configuration to allow requests from all frontend deployments
- Additional debugging logs for product fetching

These backend changes should also be deployed to ensure full compatibility.
